# KNN-Classifier-From-Scratch
This repository contains the source code of the KNN classifier that I built from scratch KNeighborsClassifier.py, and a tester file KNeighborsTester.py which uses Social_Network_Ads.csv to test the model.

Technologies Used:-
Python3.7
NumPy
Pandas
Scikit Learn (For splitting the data set into training and testing data, and for scaling the inputs)
